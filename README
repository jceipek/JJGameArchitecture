JJGameArchitecture is an experiment in creating a reusable computer game architecture.

It's central theme is a server/client communication system in which only the server is trusted with private information.

The architecture also uses an event system in which each event has a time stamp at which it is executed. In this way, the server and clients can always be synchronized.
